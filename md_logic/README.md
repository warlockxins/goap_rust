# md_logic

The inspiration is [Camunda](https://camunda.com/).

The goal is to create a decision engine based on:
 - markdown tables as DMN
 - JsonLogic as MBPN
 
 ## Notes
 - Work in progress
 - DMN expressions limited to operators "*, /, -, +, <=, >=, <, >"
 - context allows to use variables (Json Serde) as `variableName.subvariable`
